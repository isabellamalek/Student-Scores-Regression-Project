This project was undertaken by myself and my team, including Anna Radmilovich, Brooke Long, Heather Aubry, and McKenna Oâ€™Bryant. It was conducted as part of our MIS 515 advanced Python class. The primary objective was to identify the most significant factors influencing student course grades using regression analysis.

**Data Selection:** The team initially searched Kaggle for datasets containing a minimum of 1000 variables and a target variable suitable for our regression model. We identified the 'Student-Scores' dataset meeting these criteria. The dataset organized students by their ID number, and it included various attributes such as part-time job status, days absent, extracurricular involvement, study hours, and scores in different subjects. Categorical data, such as part-time job and extracurricular involvement, were compared to student average scores to identify patterns of influence on academic performance.

**Data Cleaning:** Python was used for data cleaning tasks. Columns unrelated to the research question, such as 'first name', 'last name', 'email', and 'gender', were removed. Scores in subjects like Math, History, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, English, and Geography were extracted into separate lists and averaged for each student to create an 'Average' column. Categorical data, like part-time job and extracurricular activities, were converted into binary format (True/False to 0/1) for easier integration into the regression equation.

**Data Visualization:** Once the data was cleaned, the team proceeded to visualize our regression analysis. Initially, we encountered challenges in creating a sensitivity model compared to a regression model with the target variable. We explored different regression models but struggled with defining regression lines to show average scores in correlation. The team considered various factors such as study hours vs. scores, part-time job vs. non-job, and career aspirations vs. related/non-related classes.

Overall, the project involved thorough data selection, cleaning, and visualization processes to identify key factors affecting student course grades. The team utilized Python programming and regression analysis techniques to derive meaningful insights from the dataset.
